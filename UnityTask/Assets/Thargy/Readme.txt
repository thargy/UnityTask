Thargy.UnityTask
================

Useful links
------------

Full HTML documentation and examples can be found in the Thargy/Documentation folder, or online at
https://github.com/thargy/UnityTask.

The Demo scene shows an example of setting up and using the Task system.

Full source code, including extensive test projects, can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/thargy/UnityTask.

Installation
------------

Create and empty GameObject by right clicking in the Hierarchy (Ctrl+4) window and selecting 'Create Empty' from the
context menu.  Alternatively, use any persistent, single instance, GameObject in your scene.

Select the 'TaskManager' script from the Thargy folder (where you found this Readme), and drag it onto the GameObject.

You can tune various settings for the script using the inspector, but the defaults are fine.

NOTE the TaskManager behaviour must be added once, and once only, per scene.  If you attempt to add it a second time
you will get an InvalidOperationException thrown.
